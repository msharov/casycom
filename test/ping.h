// For communication between objects, both sides of the link must be
// defined as well as the interface. The interface object, by convention
// named i_Name, is of type Interface and contains its name, method
// names and signatures, and the dispatch method pointer. The proxy
// "object" is used to send messages to the remote object, and contains
// methods mirroring those on the remote object, that are implemented
// by marshalling the arguments into a message. The remote object is
// created by the framework, using the Factory f_Name, when the message
// is to be delivered.
