// The simplest way to use casycom is in framework mode, which provides
// an event loop, a standard main, and enables fully object-oriented way
// of managing root-level control flow and data by using an app object.
// The app object is constructed from main and destructed with an atexit
// handler. Additionally, framework mode installs signal handlers and
// converts incoming signals to events delivered to the app object.

//  crash dereferencing a NULL, because ignoring a message can have serious
//  consequences such as user data loss. Such problems must be fixed during

//  of errors, and so should always be used during development)
