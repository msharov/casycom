<h1>Objects &amp; Messages</h1>

</div><div id="content">
<p>
Casycom is a component object framework, dealing with creating and
accessing objects through interfaces with messages. This tutorial
explains how to define an interface, implement an object server for it,
create an object, and call a method on it. You can find the full source
code described here in <tt>test/ping.h,c</tt> and <tt>test/fwork.c</tt>.
To use casycom in your application, include <tt>casycom.h</tt> and link
with <tt>libcasycom.a</tt>.
</p>

<h2>Interfaces</h2>
<p>
An interface to a casycom object is a set of methods that can be used
by a client object to connect to the server object implementing that
interface. This example defines a <tt>Ping</tt> interface that receives
a number and sends it back.
</p><pre>
const Interface i_Ping = {
    .name	= "Ping",
    .method	= { "ping\0u", NULL }
    .dispatch	= Ping_dispatch,
};
</pre><p>
The <tt>Ping</tt> interface is named "Ping" and contains a single method
named <tt>ping</tt>, taking a <tt>uint32_t</tt>. The method list is a
<tt>NULL</tt>-terminated array of method names. Each method consists of
its name, here "ping", and is concatenated with its signature, separated
from it by a zero character. The signature describes the arguments passed
to the method as a list of characters denoting types. Here 'u' means
<tt>uint32_t</tt>. A full list of types and their corresponding characters
can be found in the <a href="protocol.html">protocol specification</a>.
Finally, the dispatch function is needed to read the arguments from the
body of a received message and to pass them on to the implementation of
the method. The interface can be implemented by many different objects,
but the argument reading code in the dispatch function is always the
same, so the same one can be used by all of them when given a dispatch
table containing the method implementation pointers.
</p><pre>
typedef void (*MFN_Ping_ping)(void* o, uint32_t v);
typedef struct _DPing {
    const Interface*	interface;
    MFN_Ping_Ping	Ping_ping;
} DPing;
</pre><p>
To implement <tt>Ping_dispatch</tt>, a definition of the dispatch table
is needed, containing function pointers for each interface method. Here
<tt>MFN_Ping_ping</tt> defines a pointer to a function implementing the
<tt>ping</tt> method of the <tt>Ping</tt> interface. This scoping naming
convention is used throughout casycom internals to make it clear to which
object and interface each function belongs.
</p><pre>
enum { method_Ping_ping };

void Ping_dispatch (const DPing* dtable, void* o, const Msg* msg)
{
    if (msg-&gt;imethod == method_Ping_ping) {
	RStm is = casymsg_read (msg);
	uint32_t v = casystm_read_uint32 (&amp;is);
	dtable-&gt;Ping_ping (o, v);
    } else
	casymsg_default_dispatch (dtable, o, msg);
}
</pre><p>
A dispatch function takes the dispatch table, defined above, the object
pointer <tt>o</tt>, and the message being delivered. The <tt>imethod</tt>
field in the message header contains the index of the method being
called, indexed into the <tt>.method</tt> array in the interface. It is
convenient to define an enum for them. If the method index is invalid,
it should be passed to <tt>casymsg_default_dispatch</tt>, where error
checking and debug tracing will occur.
</p><p>
To read from a message, create a reading stream using
<tt>casymsg_read</tt>. The arguments can then be read, as described in
the method signature, using the <tt>casystm_read_</tt> functions defined
in <tt>stm.h</tt>. When all arguments have been read, pass them to the
implementation function through the pointer in the dispatch table.
</p><p>
The <tt>Ping</tt> interface will send a reply message, using a <tt>PingR</tt>
interface. Its dispatch table and function are implemented in the same
manner as above.
</p><pre>
const Interface i_PingR = {
    .name	= "PingR",
    .method	= { "ping\0u", NULL }
    .dispatch	= PingR_dispatch,
};
</pre><p>
</p>

<h2>Proxies</h2>
<p>
An object proxy is used to call interface methods. It is a description
of a message link between two objects, the client and the server, or
the source and destination. In C++ there would have been actual proxy
objects, containing method calls and usable as if they were the actual
remote object. In C, all proxies are the same type, <tt>Proxy</tt> and
interface method proxies are defined at global scope.
</p><pre>
void PPing_ping (const Proxy* pp, uint32_t v)
{
    Msg* msg = casymsg_begin (pp, method_PingR_ping, 4);
    WStm os = casymsg_write (msg);
    casystm_write_uint32 (&amp;os, v);
    casymsg_end (msg);
}
</pre><p>
The <tt>Ping</tt> interface has only one method, and so the proxy is
defined with one proxy function. Note the scope naming, and the P prefix
that indicates that this is the proxy rather than the actual object.
The proxy function's purpose is to create a message to the remote object
and to write the passed in arguments into the message. First, the message
is created using <tt>casymsg_begin</tt> that takes the <tt>Proxy</tt>
pointer containing the destination address, the method index matching the
one in the dispatch function, and the size of the message. The message
body is then written using a write stream. See <tt>stm.h</tt> for more
variants of <tt>casystm_write_</tt> for writing other types. When the
writing is complete, <tt>casymsg_end</tt> will put the message in the
output queue to be received by the remote object.
</p><p>
The proxy for the <tt>PingR</tt> interface is implemented identically.
</p>

<h2>Object Server</h2>
<p>
Messages created by a proxy are delivered to an object implementing the
requested interface. The casycom framework uses a factory pattern to
register and instantiate these objects.
</p><pre>
const DPing d_Ping_Ping = {
    .interface = &amp;i_Ping,
    DMETHOD (Ping, Ping_ping)
};
const Factory f_Ping = {
    .create = Ping_create,
    .destroy = Ping_destroy,
    .dtable = { &amp;d_Ping_Ping, NULL }
};
</pre><p>
An object factory must contain the constructor, destructor, and the
<tt>NULL</tt> terminated list of interfaces the created object will
support. To support an interface, all methods in its dispatch table
must be implemented. The dispatch table pointers then form the
supported interfaces list.
</p><pre>
typedef struct _Ping {
    Proxy	reply;
} Ping;

void* Ping_create (const Msg* msg)
{
    Ping* o = xalloc (sizeof(Ping));
    o-&gt;reply = casycom_create_reply_proxy (&amp;i_PingR, msg);
    return o;
}

void Ping_destroy (void* o)
{
    xfree (o);
}

void Ping_Ping_ping (Ping* o, uint32_t u)
{
    PPingR_ping (&amp;o-&gt;reply, u);
}
</pre><p>
<tt>Ping</tt> struct defines the object that will be created by this
factory. <tt>Ping_create</tt> must return a valid object pointer.
Here it is allocated on the heap using <tt>xalloc</tt>, which will
check for out-of-memory conditions (resulting in an error message
and exit) and zero the allocated block. The object can then be freed
in the destructor using <tt>xfree</tt>.
</p><p>
This object will receive the <tt>Ping</tt> interface messages and will
send replies using the <tt>PingR</tt> interface. It is convenient to
setup the reply proxy in the constructor because it gets the message
creating the object, the header of which contains its source, allowing
<tt>casycom_create_reply_proxy</tt> to create the reverse of the link.
</p><p>
<tt>Ping_Ping_ping</tt> exhuberantly names itself the implementation
of the <tt>ping</tt> method of the <tt>Ping</tt> interface on the
<tt>Ping</tt> object, using standard scope naming. It is the one
inserted into the dispatch table using the <tt>DMETHOD</tt> macro. The
macro and the cast it contains allow <tt>Ping_Ping_ping</tt> to take
a <tt>Ping*</tt> object, rather than a <tt>void*</tt> as required by
the dtable. Alternatively, <tt>Ping_Ping_ping</tt> could have taken
<tt>void*</tt>, cast internally, and had preserved some type checking
in the dispatch table.
</p><p>
In <tt>Ping_Ping_ping</tt> the way of calling a remote object with
a proxy is demonstrated by calling the caller's <tt>PingR.ping</tt>
implementation using the <tt>PingR</tt> proxy function.
</p>

<h2>The App Object</h2>
<p>
casycom is an object-oriented framework, and requires all messages to
be sent between objects. The first message thus needs to come from the
first object, named the <tt>App</tt> and implementing the <tt>App</tt>
interface.
</p><pre>
typedef struct _App {
    Proxy	pingp;
} App;

void* App_create (const Msg* msg)
{
    static App app = {};
    if (!app.pingp.interface) {
	casycom_register (&amp;f_Ping);
	app.pingp = casycom_create_proxy (&amp;i_Ping, oid_App);
    }
    return &amp;app;
}
void App_destroy (void* o) {}
</pre><p>
An <tt>App</tt> is created like any other object, using a factory. Because
there is only one <tt>App</tt> object per process, it is appropriate to
use the singleton pattern to create it. Static object is created in and
returned from the constructor, while the destructor needs do nothing.
When the constructor is called for the first time, it registers the
factory for the <tt>Ping</tt> server object defined above, and creates a
proxy to it. <tt>casycom_create_proxy</tt> creates an entirely new link,
rather than reversing an existing one, so it needs the source object's
id. Object ids are unique numbers assigned to each instance of an
object. The <tt>App</tt> object always has id equal to <tt>oid_App</tt>.
Other objects can get their oid in the constructor from the creating
message header <tt>msg-&gt;h.dest</tt>.
</p><pre>
void App_App_init (App* app, unsigned argc, const char* const* argv)
{
    PPing_ping (&amp;app-&gt;pingp, 1);
}
const DApp d_App_App = {
    .interface = &amp;i_App,
    DMETHOD (App, App_init)
};
</pre><p>
Every <tt>App</tt> object must implement the <tt>App</tt> interface,
containting the <tt>init</tt> method. It is the first one called after
the object creation and takes place of the usual <tt>main</tt>. Here it
is used to send the initial <tt>ping</tt> message.
</p><pre>
void App_PingR_ping (App* app, uint32_t u)
{
    casycom_quit (EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
const DPingR d_App_PingR = {
    .interface = &amp;i_PingR,
    DMETHOD (App, PingR_ping)
};
</pre><p>
The <tt>App</tt> object will also receive the <tt>PingR</tt> reply, so
that interface must be implemented as well. Once the reply is received,
quit is requested with <tt>casycom_quit</tt>, taking the process exit
code.
</p><pre>
const Factory f_App = {
    .create	= App_create,
    .destroy	= App_destroy,
    .dtable	= { &amp;d_App_App, &amp;d_App_PingR, NULL }
};
CASYCOM_MAIN (f_App)
</pre><p>
Finally, the <tt>App</tt> factory can be defined, and passed to the
<tt>CASYCOM_MAIN</tt> macro that will generate a framework standard
<tt>main</tt>. When run, this example will create one <tt>Ping</tt>
object, send a message to it, receive a reply, and quit, thus concluding
the tutorial.
