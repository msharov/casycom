<h1>Frameworkless</h1>

</div><div id="content">
<p>
Casycom is normally used as a complete framework, providing the message
loop and requiring a root app object, but sometimes an application already
uses an event-driven framework and its message loop. This tutorial
demonstrates how to integrate casycom message loop into another.
</p><pre>
void OnChildSignal (int signo) { wait (NULL); }

int main (void)
{
    casycom_init();
    signal (SIGCHLD, OnChildSignal);
    casycom_enable_externs();
</pre><p>
To manually initialize casycom in non-framework mode, call
<tt>casycom_init</tt>. One notable difference with framework mode
operation is that signal handlers are not installed. Normally casycom
catches all the signals and converts them to messages to the <tt>App</tt>
object. With only <tt>casycom_init</tt>, explicit signal handlers must be
present, such as this <tt>SIGCHLD</tt> handler to clean up the launched
object server.
</p><pre>
typedef struct _PingCaller {
    Proxy	pingp;
    Proxy	externp;
} PingCaller;

const iid_t eil_Ping[] = { &amp;i_Ping, NULL };

void* PingCaller_Create (const Msg* msg)
{
    PingCaller* o = (PingCaller*) xalloc (sizeof(PingCaller));
    o-&gt;externp = casycom_create_proxy (&amp;i_Extern, msg-&gt;h.dest);
    PExtern_LaunchPipe ("ipcom", "-p", eil_Ping);
}

void PingCaller_ExternR_Connected (PingCaller* o)
{
    o-&gt;pingp = casycom_create_proxy (&amp;i_Ping, o-&gt;externp.src);
    PPing_Ping (&amp;o-&gt;pingp, 1);
}

void PingCaller_PingR_Ping (PingCaller* o, uint32_t u)
{
    casycom_quit (EXIT_SUCCESS);
}

const DPingR d_PingCaller_PingR = {
    .interface = &amp;i_PingR,
    DMETHOD (PingCaller, PingR_Ping)
};
const DExternR d_PingCaller_ExternR = {
    .interface = &amp;i_ExternR,
    DMETHOD (PingCaller, ExternR_Connected)
};
const Factory f_PingCaller = {
    .Create	= PingCaller_Create,
    .dtable	= { &amp;d_PingCaller_PingR, &amp;d_PingCaller_ExternR, NULL }
};

int main (void)
{
    ...
    casycom_register (&amp;f_PingCaller);
    casycom_create_object (&amp;i_PingR);
    ...
}
</pre><p>
Because there is no App, no casycom objects exist initially. Objects
are normally created when they are needed to receive a message. But
an object can also be created manually by one of the interfaces it
supports. Casycom always requires messages to be passed between objects,
so an object must be created to send the <tt>Ping</tt> message. Here,
the <tt>PingCaller</tt> object is defined, and then created using
<tt>casycom_create_object</tt> by instantiating interface <tt>PingR</tt>.
</p><p>
This way there is no single app object, but multiple objects can be
created to serve the same purpose. <tt>PingCaller</tt> uses its
constructor to create an <tt>Extern</tt> connection and to launch
ipcom as a private object server. Then it waits for the connection
and sends a ping through it.
</p><pre>
int main (void)
{
    ...
    while (!casycom_is_quitting()) {
	bool haveMessages = casycom_loop_once();
	size_t nFds = Timer_WatchListSize();
	if (nFds) {
	    struct pollfd fds [nFds];
	    int timeout = 0;
	    nFds = Timer_WatchListForPoll (fds, nFds, haveMessages ? NULL : &amp;timeout);
	    poll (fds, nFds, timeout);
	}
    }
    return casycom_exit_code();
}
</pre><p>
Once a casycom object exists and there are messages in the queue,
a message loop will have to run to process them. With another message
loop normally in control, the casycom loop functionality will have
to be interleaved into it as illustrated above.
</p><p>
Here a top-level message loop iterates and waits in <tt>poll</tt> when
nothing needs doing. The loop will have its own exit conditions, but
with casycom in use, it also needs to check <tt>casycom_is_quitting</tt>.
This is required to correctly handle errors set by <tt>casycom_error</tt>.
</p><p>
Casycom messages will then have to be processed somewhere in the loop.
<tt>casycom_loop_once</tt> will process the input queue, swap it with the
output queue, and then stop, returning <tt>true</tt> when the queues are
not empty. When messages are available, <tt>poll</tt> should not block,
but only check the fds for the requested conditions.
</p><p>
The rest of the loop deals with file descriptors and timers being watched
by casycom. The message loop must provide some way of waiting for them,
such as by using <tt>poll</tt>. <tt>Timer_WatchListSize</tt> returns the
number of fds and timers being watched. <tt>Timer_WatchListForPoll</tt>
will fill the given <tt>pollfd</tt> array and will optionally set a
timeout to support pure timers in the list.  Additional file descriptors
can be appended at this point and control passed to <tt>poll</tt> until
something happens.
