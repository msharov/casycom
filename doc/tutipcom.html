<h1>Interprocess</h1>

</div><div id="content">
<p>
One important benefit of data coupling objects through messaging is
the ability to use objects in other processes or on other computers.
This tutorial demonstrates how object servers are created and accessed
in casycom through a socket.
</p><p>
The first question to consider is how object servers are found and
launched. Other COM frameworks typically solve this through a specialized
service that does just that. DBUS, for example, has the dbus-daemon
service through which all messages must be routed and which will launch
registered object servers as needed. Casycom does not use a central
message hub service like this (although one could be implemented),
but instead expects applications to connect to object servers through
well-known sockets. The servers themselves can either be started at boot
time, launched by the applications that need them, or by using systemd
socket activation. This last method is the easiest and the preferred one.
Systemd is already adopted by a majority of Linux distributions and some
of the remainder also use an init that can do socket activation. Lacking
that, a standard launching service could be implemented to do this.
</p>

<h2>Client Side</h2>
<p>
Interprocess communication in casycom needs to be enabled explicitly,
because over three quarters of the library is pulled in when it is
used. Sometimes it is useful to just use a local object message loop,
and get it for a very low cost of about 3k of object code linked in.
So, to begin using external objects, <tt>casycom_enable_externs()</tt>
needs to be called, likely in <tt>App_Init</tt>.
</p><p>
Connections to external objects are managed by an <tt>Extern</tt>
object, of which one is created per socket. On the client side, it
is sufficient. On the server side, the socket is being listened on
will generate the actual connection sockets, so a separate object,
<tt>ExternServer</tt>, is needed to keep track of them and to listen
for clients on the socket.
</p><pre>
const iid_t eil_Ping[] = { &amp;i_Ping, NULL };

void App_App_Init (App* app, unsigned argc, char* const* argv)
{
    casycom_enable_externs();
    app-&gt;externp = casycom_create_proxy (&amp;i_Extern, oid_App);
    if (0 &gt; PExtern_ConnectUserLocal (&amp;app-&gt;externp, "ipcom.socket", eil_Ping))
	casycom_error ("Extern_ConnectUserLocal: %s", strerror(errno));
}
</pre><p>
The client side creates a proxy to an <tt>Extern</tt> object
and asks it to connect to a specific socket, here "ipcom.socket".
<tt>PExtern_ConnectUserLocal</tt> will connect to the socket in the
user's runtime directory, the standard for user socket location, obtained
from the environment variable <tt>XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</tt>, typically set
to <tt>/run/user/&lt;uid&gt;</tt>. Other connect call variants can be
found in <tt>xcom.h</tt>.
</p><p>
The third argument to <tt>_Connect</tt> is the NULL-terminated list of
imported interfaces that will be created on the other side of the socket.
Here the list contains only the <tt>Ping</tt> interface. Note that the
factory for it is not registered - that will be done on the server side.
</p><p>
The <tt>_Connect</tt> function returns the file descriptor of the
connected socket. If the socket can not be opened, -1 will be returned,
and <tt>errno</tt> will be set appropriately. Errors in casycom
should be reported by calling <tt>casycom_error</tt>, a printf-like
call that sets the error string.  Error handling will begin as soon
as the failing function returns, and works somewhat like exception
propagation. The object originating the message routed to the failed
function will be contacted and its <tt>.Error</tt> function pointer
(in the <tt>Factory</tt>) will be called, if present. If the error
handler returns <tt>true</tt>, the error will be considered handled
and the execution will resume normally. Otherwise, the handling object
is considered failed as well, and its creator object will be given the
chance to handle the error next. If nobody handles the error, it will
be printed and the process will terminate.
</p><p>
If the error occurs in the remote object, in another process, the error
will be forwarded to the object's caller, in the client process. On the
server side, the error will be considered handled and it will be up to
the client to decide what to do about it.
</p><pre>
void App_ExternR_Connected (App* app, const ExternInfo* einfo)
{
    if (einfo-&gt;interfaces.size &lt; 1 || einfo-&gt;interfaces.d[0] != &amp;i_Ping)
	return casycom_error ("connected to server that does not support the Ping interface");
    app-&gt;pingp = casycom_create_proxy (&amp;i_Ping, oid_App);
    PPing_Ping (&amp;app-&gt;pingp, 1);
}
</pre><p>
<tt>Extern</tt> connections are opened asynchronously, so the <tt>App</tt>
must wait until the <tt>ExternR_Connected</tt> notification before
any imported objects can be created. The notification contains an
<tt>ExternInfo</tt> with a list of interfaces actually available on this
connection, the credentials of the process on the other side, and a flag
specifying whether it is on a UNIX domain socket, which indicates that
credentials and file descriptors can be sent over it.
</p><p>
Once the <tt>App</tt> verifies that the <tt>Ping</tt> interface is indeed
present, proxies to objects of that type can now be created and used in
the same manner as they were for local objects, with the <tt>PingR</tt>
reply arriving the same way. Sending <tt>Ping</tt> messages before the
connected notification arrives results in an error.
</p><pre>
void App_PingR_Ping (App* app, uint32_t u)
    { casycom_quit (EXIT_SUCCESS); }

void App_Error (void* vapp, oid_t eoid, const char* msg)
{
    casycom_log (LOG_ERR, "error from object %hu: %s", eoid, msg);
    return false;
}

void App_ObjectDestroyed (void* vapp, oid_t oid)
{
    printf ("Called object %hu has been destroyed\n", oid);
}

const DApp d_App_App = {
    .interface = &amp;i_App,
    DMETHOD (App, App_Init)
};
const DPingR d_App_PingR = {
    .interface = &amp;i_PingR,
    DMETHOD (App, PingR_Ping)
};
const DExternR d_App_ExternR = {
    .interface = &amp;i_ExternR,
    DMETHOD (App, ExternR_Connected)
};
const Factory f_App = {
    .Create	= App_Create,
    .Destroy	= App_Destroy,
    .Error	= App_Error,
    .ObjectDestroyed = App_ObjectDestroyed,
    .dtable	= { &amp;d_App_App, &amp;d_App_PingR, &amp;d_App_ExternR, NULL }
};
CASYCOM_MAIN (f_App)
</pre><p>
Finishing off the client side, there are two additional <tt>Factory</tt>
methods demonstrated. The <tt>.Error</tt> function has been explained
above. <tt>.ObjectDestroyed</tt> is called on an object when it has a
proxy to an object that has been deleted. Usually there would be no other
notification that this has happened. The proxy, of course, is still valid
after this, but messages sent through it will result in a new object
being created at the other end of the link. <tt>ObjectDestroyed</tt>
can thus be useful in situations when the calling object keeps pointers
into the called one.
</p>

<h2>Server Side</h2>
<p>
The server side needs to bind to a socket and listen for incoming
connections. The recommended way is to use an <tt>ExternServer</tt>
to do these things as well as spawn an <tt>Extern</tt> object to manage
each accepted connection.
</p><pre>
const iid_t eil_Ping[] = { &amp;i_Ping, NULL };

void App_App_Init (App* app, unsigned argc, char* const* argv)
{
    casycom_enable_externs();
    casycom_register (&amp;f_ExternServer);
    casycom_register (&amp;f_Ping);
    app-&gt;externp = casycom_create_proxy (&amp;i_ExternServer, oid_App);
    if (sd_listen_fds())
	PExternServer_Open (&amp;app-&gt;externp, SD_LISTEN_FDS_START+0, eil_Ping);
    else if (0 &gt; PExternServer_BindUserLocal (&amp;app-&gt;externp, "ipcom.socket", eil_Ping))
	casycom_error ("ExternServer_BindUserLocal: %s", strerror(errno));
}
</pre><p>
Here the <tt>ExternServer</tt> and <tt>Ping</tt> interfaces are
registered.  It is recommended that systemd socket activation be
supported. To do so, call <tt>sd_listen_fds</tt> to determine how many
sockets have been passed from systemd. Although there may be more than
one, this example will only bind to the first one. Supporting multiple
fds will require an <tt>ExternServer</tt> object for each. The passed-in
fds begin at <tt>SD_LISTEN_FDS_START</tt>.
</p><p>
If not launched through socket activation, "ipcom.socket" is created
in the user's runtime directory in the same manner it was connected
to in the client. Here the interface list contains <em>exported</em>
interfaces; the server side does not normally import any.
</p><p>
<tt>ExternServer</tt> forwards the <tt>ExternR_Connected</tt>
notifications to the <tt>App</tt>, requiring the latter to implement
<tt>ExternR</tt>, but in this example the handler for that does nothing.
</p><pre>
void ServerApp_App_Init (App* app, unsigned argc, char* const* argv)
{
    casycom_enable_externs();
    casycom_register (&amp;f_Ping);
    app-&gt;externp = casycom_create_proxy (&amp;i_Extern, oid_App);
    PExtern_Open (&amp;app-&gt;externp, STDIN_FILENO, EXTERN_SERVER, NULL, eil_Ping);
}

void ClientApp_App_Init (App* app, unsigned argc, char* const* argv)
{
    casycom_enable_externs();
    app-&gt;externp = casycom_create_proxy (&amp;i_Extern, oid_App);
    PExtern_LaunchPipe (&amp;app-&gt;externp, "ipcom", "-p", eil_Ping);
}
</pre><p>
There is also a more direct way to make an object server: by making
just one connection and using one <tt>Extern</tt> object at each
end. This method does not require creating a public socket, and so
is appropriate for use with private object servers. The server uses
<tt>PExtern_Open</tt> to attach to the socket on stdin, and the client
uses <tt>PExtern_LaunchPipe</tt> to launch the server process and create
the the socket pipe. The client side imports <tt>Ping</tt>, the server
side exports it.
